# Interconnected Markdown
## What is it?
This repository provides a large library of 10.000 pseudo-english markdown files which are heavily interconnected with [[page links]]. These can be used for performance and regression testing of markdown libraries and applications.

If you want to know more about how these haven been generated, please continue reading [here](https://www.goedel.io/p/tft-performance-methodology).

You can also find various different export formats like Roam JSON (JSON Directory) oder Roam EDN (EDN Directory). 

I have sliced the Library in different pieces from 500s to 10.000s.
